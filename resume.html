                  I have become a skilled researcher, computational engineer, educator, mentor, and manager in my experiences at Pitt. I am preparing for a Ph.D. in computational engineering so that I can tailor my skills towards my ultimate career as an educator at the intersection between computing and engineering.

									<h3>Education</h3>
								</header>
								<p>
									I'm a BPhil Candidate at Pitt. This degree entails leading an independent research project (see OpenViewFactor below) and a summative thesis defense with my committee of select advisors. This designation replaces the default "Bachelor of Science in Engineering" for my Engineering Science degree.
								</p>
                <p>
                  Through my undergraduate degree, I live at the intersection of mechanical engineering, materials science, and physics. I value having a multidisciplinary background like this because today's interesting problems exist at the boundaries of fields. My certificates in Sustainability and Engineering Simulations Design broaden my (mostly) mechanical engineering background and capture my dedication to build a future worth living in. To wrap everything together, I completed a minor in Physics. As a result, I approach engineering problems from multiple perspectives and can understand multidsciplinary conversations with other professionals.

									<h3>Research</h3>
								</header>
                <h4>OpenViewFactor</h4>
								<p>
									I am developing an object-oriented, parallelized C++/CUDA solver for calculating radiation view factors. This project is a crucial piece of our group's overarching goal to develop more robust performance models of radioisotope thermoelectric generators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As part of this project, I have investigated the failure conditions for numerical integration techniques and their relationships with mesh refinement algorithms and integration quadrature implementations. I have also been developing a Python macro interface for analytic validation and OpenViewFactor solver scripting in order to enable large studies for complex systems.
                </p>
                <h4>John C. Mascaro Scholar</h4>
                <p>
                  I conducted an independent summer research project with Dr. David Sanchez at Pitt. I studied the potential for nanobubbles of nonreactive gas species to have a meaningful impact on pollutant oxidation in ultraviolet disinfection.
                </p>
                <h4>Geo-Environmental Engineering Research Intern</h4>
                <p>
                  I supported several graduate students in Dr. Jay Meegoda's group as a high school intern. We studied the impact of ozone nanobubbles on the oxidation of common pollutants like chromium.

                <h4>Nuclear and Emerging Technologies for Space</h4>
                <p>
                  I worked with another student in our research group to submit a paper for review to the NETS 2025 conference, entitled <i>"Efficient Computational Method for Three-Dimensional Thermally- and Electrically-Coupled Performance Prediction of GPHS-RTG."</i> I created tailored geometries to represent individual heat source bricks, individual unicouple hot-shoes, and specific subsections of insulation in order to study thousands of unique view factors. My work was pivotal in enabling the thermal resistance network implementation.
                </p>

                <h4>Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review</h4>
                <p>
                  I submitted a paper to an undergraduate journal at Pitt, entitled <i>"Robust and Expedited Methodologies for Evaluating Radiation View Factors."</i> This article summarizes my work studying the Single and Double Area Integration methods, how they pair with mesh refinement and integration quadrature implementations, and specific applications to some geometries within the RTG.
